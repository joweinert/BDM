# ðŸ”¥ Big Data Management Project ðŸ”¥
This project leverages a modern Big Data architecture to orchestrate data ingestion, landing zones, and processing using Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, and MinIO. Below are the key UIs to monitor and interact with the system:

## Service Dashboards
- **Airflow Dashboard ðŸ’¨** <br>
http://localhost:8080 <br>
Monitor DAGs, schedule tasks, and manage workflows using Airflowâ€™s web interface.

- **MinIO UI ðŸª£** <br>
http://localhost:9001 <br>
Access and manage the object storage. Create buckets, upload/download files, and manage data using MinIOâ€™s S3-compatible web console.

- **Spark Master UI âœ¨** <br>
http://localhost:8081 <br>
Keep track of the Spark clusterâ€™s performance, monitor job execution, and view worker node status.
